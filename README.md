Liquibase java.util.Logger Extension
========================


This extension changes the Liquibase logging system to use the java.util.Logger rather than STDOUT. The SequenceTable extension allows databases that do not support sequences to natively create "sequence tables". Sequence tables can be used by Hibernate for its SequenceStyleGenerator functionality or used directly through SQL.
