Liquibase java.util.Logger Extension
========================

# DEPRECATED

Liquibase now uses java.util.Logger by default, so this extension is no longer needed


This extension changes the Liquibase logging system to use the java.util.Logger rather than STDOUT.

### Download

Download the extension jar from the [project releases tab](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-javalogger/releases)
